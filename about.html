                    As the COVID-19 disease rapidly spread around the world, it brought the entire world to a screeching halt. Mask mandates were introduced, schools were shut down, and government orders for in-person businesses to close up shop soon began to roll out. As local businesses began to grapple with business continuity, ignoring digital presence was out of the question, but it's not a simple feat either. At Plonk Solutions, we understand better than anyone the challenge of engaging your customers in the digital world. We also understand the importance of conveying mission statements to your customer base. Here, we develop top-tier, professional websites to revamp your digital presence.
